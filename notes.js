/*

user stories:

- only followdees locations get copied into mine, not products (to be able to distinguish who they come from - might be useful later)
          - locations ARE copied - so i can add my own products there     (in case other user would delete that location from his data)
          = products are kept under their users data, they dont get copied
- i can find other users to follow and follow them
- app auto-fetches followdees data (store them on my device local storage) - when? on app start or login/registration
- i can add product (to currently open location)
          - information contains
                    product type *
                    product name *
                    description
                    price
                    rating *
